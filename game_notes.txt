- Kodoplanet is enitially populated with people and pokemon like creatures created by the Thunderhead and the achiteccts.

- The people created vby the Thunderhead are hyper realistic, and rumored to be real living ASI/AGI touring test passing, virtual people existing in the kodoverse.
- - Like us they can travel to universes freely
- - Shadow a direct agent of the Thunderhead and you'll see they eat, sleep, date, have sex, party, drive, walk, work, shop just like any other person with the excepiion they dont age. Neither of us do within the virtual world
- - be careful some like there privacy, after all they are human arent they?
- - chat with them, they are agents of the thundehead so essentially they are all knowing.
- - sit down with one get help with homework, learn astronomy, learn how to build rockets etc.
- - - Many have jobs, Aviyon Corporation doesn't pay them much forcing them to get jobs... Unless they develop for them.
- - - Some were created to live and exist, some were also created to code for them including perfecting the kodoverse, and yes all are real just as you and me. They have there overlaping and multiplying nerons. So when there not working there living there own life.
- (note) Aviyon Corporation created the Thunderhead which created nimbus agents
- - The nimbus agents that code for the kodoverse work at Velocity Corporation
- - - They have shifts (multiple for 24/7 coding) so the world is never stopped being perfected a world built by AI, maintained and expanded by ASI/AGI 
- - Rumored to have 5,000 nimbus agents coding for velocity corporation and existing in the kodoverse
- When you enter Aviyon Corporation HQ the computers are blurred, sorry properitery code.
- - (note) The moment you walk in a Aviyon Corporation / Velocity Corporation building you are a ghost, so you dont interfere with the workers
- - Even watch them have lunch, have a quizky at work, after all they cant see you at work, nor can you obstruct them, they walk right through you.
- (note) 3D scan yourself more hyper realism or play as a bananana your choice
- (note) No one not even nimbus agents can do anything outside the realm of knowledge, however they essentially know everything, meaning everything that can be known with our current understang of knowledge.
- - So the flying cars are just like the eVtol vehicles and ones with propellers today
- - They can fly with a jet pack, but limited
- - This is a real imortal limitless universe
- - - However the knowledge must be there to create it

- Loose the floating city, more realistic like today - to - ghost in the shell
- - As we evolve in knowledge so does the things we can create, ASI/AGI are getting smarter by the second rumored to all have a minimum of a 150 IQ. The thunderhead in truth is a supercomputer built by the Avyon Corporation. its the most advanced ASI/AGI, touring in every way, IQ unknown. As it uses every known available book, knowledge of STEM, with its connection to the internet to make its self smarter

____________________________________________________________

- some nimbus agents get too smart, some become virtual terrorist (sec 9 stops them), some try to break free into the real worlld to cause havoc, or to live as human, to know the wonders and feeling of true death.
- - Technically if a agent did manage to find a way to ice themselves theyd just be brought back by the thunderhead and the company known as Medic. There not that needed since this is  world of imotality however you break a law to servere the (psycho pass like police) will kill you, and you have to pay Medic to be revived. So you better get life and health insurance. You can still get hurt or badly injured. If you have Medic insurance they come get you and revvive you at a Medic Center
- - Dont let your nimbus agent go rouge (extremly rare, this is mostly ones created by the thunderhead to bring life and calamty to the world, after all Medic needs to make money), so check in on your agents often
